Data Summmarization:

Extractive:

. Easy to achieve
. Less CPU consumption
. NLTK library

- doesnt value the importance of word

Abstractive:

- More CPU consumption
- Transformers and Pipelines
- important sentence


Hugging face -> python -> html/css/js

Transformer:
encoder and decoder

A transformer is an algorithm that can transform one DataFrame into another DataFrame

Estimator:
An estimator is an algorithm that can be fit on a datafrane to produce atransformer

Pipeline: A pipeline chains multiple transformers and Estimators together to specify an ML workflow

Hugging Face - Pipeline

The pipelines are a great and easy way to use models for inference. these pipelines are objects that abstract most of the complex code from the library, offering a simple API dedicated to several tasks

Training: process of creating ML algorithm

Inference: Inference refers to the process of using trained ML algorithm to make a prediction

virtual environment:
when there is an upgrade in package. A playground where we find a space, other areas are not effected. the whole system does not get impacted

Api token:
randomly generated number

requests: http

backend to front we use jinja for flask {{}}
